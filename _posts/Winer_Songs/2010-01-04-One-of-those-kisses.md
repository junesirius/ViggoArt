And you'll recall nights

already coming into winter

when we'd return alone

with the stars

and the moon

speaking little

without horizons

calm

our eyes

on the gentle bends

of the deserted highway

hands and faces so close

not knowing

but perhaps knowing something

easy together

relishing our journey

in that new world

that life

those minutes

those uncounted hours

unhurried

unquestioning

owning only the simple joy

of knowing each other

<br>

Truth

though troublesome

is contagious

I encounter rtees

lowering themselves

anywhere I wander

telling me their secrets

am soaked by the rain

blue and red

so many colours

you're the island I imagine

hear tentative rumblings

from an old Russian piano

drowning

releasing

poor preludes

quieting

towards a better silence

notice changes in your skin

sounds escape your fingers

you've an owl's gaze

steady and luminous

guiding me

so I'll follow your dreaming

am in agreement

with everything you send me

your voice parts the mist

my lips

drink beats of your drum

precious rib cage

that vibrates

with exhausted cries

the force of well-being hurts

of our clean connection

<br>

I think

the mysterious clemency

of all that's holy

for placing you in my way

we could track together

if we wish to see

what lies ahead

advance hand in hand

mouth in mouth

tied by our entrails

memories

toasting

the gift of the future

grateful for the flood of Yes

fear has no place

in the sudden paradise

that feeds tenderness

want to wash you

comb your hair

and won't dry you

want you to lie down

on me

soak me

melt me

sink me

with the purity of your desire

am becoming ill

accept it

you call

I answer

didn't know when you left

nor do I know that you're gone

how much you'd wanted to see

how much was left unsaid

<br>

When I was halted last night

by your sage acknowledgment

of the lift-off I sought to deny

you asked me

if I needed anything

you

I said

seek you

under this winter sky

awake

pronouncing our fragile language

native tongue

words

embedded in my bones

salt staining my lips

with traces of your absence

flew by night

frightened of not finding you

miss your flight

your air that saves and heals

am bearded

I warn you

it fills me to hear from you

and I want you to know it

I breathe with you

keep the caresses you gave me

and will return them

<br>

Don't know this haze's origin

that face's eye for eye

that upper lip

remain ignorant of other music

craving your lid's fluttering shadow

smell you still

close curtains

to see what you left

strangle questions

answers

strive in vain to cure doubts

pretending they're meaningless

your body is my world

all I see

want to be your sun

set on your shoulders

feel you close your eyes

in our nest's repose

adore your heart's beating

that coursing river of blood

that marks the rhythm

of my broken strides

there are embers

of the unforeseen vigil

I recall precisely

without sorrow

or end the beauty

of the surprise

the moon just completing itself

cold knees

half-packed suitcase

pictures and phrases

hung on the mirror

the mute alarm clock

nose against bedsheet

your body is my world

finish me

with one of those kisses
