The afterthought of chimes

filtres in from next door

am under the echo

not listening

so much as evoking it from time to time

as I look over the results of my landscaping

and weeding from a white wicker chair

<br>

An errant vine has sprouted

two blue flowers

where it reaches

roots of the lemon tree

they are beautiful

I am suspicious

are they a diversion

an entreaty to keep me

from cutting back the runner?

I'll keep the flowers

put them in a saucer

by your bed
