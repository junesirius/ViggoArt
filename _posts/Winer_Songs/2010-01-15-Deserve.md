... I missed seeing the moon

and lost an earring...

<br>

I fell

ask

that you leave

happy

will do all

to understand

your absence

as a test

proof

of what's won

what remains

what I am

without you

<br>

With this silence

oblivion

announces

its return

pure

heavy

total

I hush

falter

breathe

the emptiness

that demands

and takes

my surrender

<br>

You'll fly

to another nest

to blood far away

from my mouth

and what I said

to you last night

you were alone

submerged

in darkness

answering me

opening me

giving yourself

letting yourself be

<br>

I reject rebirth

refuse to go on

to forget you

will bear punishments

my harshness

deserves

unfazed

broken

burn day and night

tears

neither extinguish

your light

nor forgive

aimlessness

I succumb to

what did I do

to founder

in you?
