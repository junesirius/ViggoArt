It's not

so you'll think

or decide anything

it's not

so you'll miss me

or desire me more

that I ask

if I should be quiet

<br>

It's not

to scare you

or out of rancour

it's not

because I changed

since last night

that I sing you

what I fear

<br>

It's not

that I don't hear you

or believe in us

it's not

because I tire

or surrender

that I show you

a door

<br>

It's not

so you'll suffer

or repent

it's not 

so you'll dream me

or to ennoble myself

that I dare

offer a good-bye

<br>

It's not

so you'll accept

and agree

it's not

to lose you

or let you go

that I give you

what I love
