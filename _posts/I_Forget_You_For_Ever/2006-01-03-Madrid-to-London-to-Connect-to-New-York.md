I see the carpet, your forehead, plasma screams, speculation dividends, neglected islands, and one lost leather ball that will weather under a bush more than a year begore it is found. People's knees give out; tendon, cartilage, and bone wither, empty bellies groan odes to full bellies, rot invites rot, new towers proclaim nature's native impermanence, you always quote yourself, all languages are one as they are exhaled, stuttered, chanted, constantly breaking down into new rhythms. Kill or be filled, luckiest dying allows just enough time to dream of living. Could I be more mistaken in consciously journeying to your skin, planning to see you? It is my intention, if I may be so bold, to remain close to you throughout the evening. Have I forgotten someone, some reason for moving so suddenly away from opal Norman skies and gilded, empty-bedded dawn? Is procrastination a legitimate art form, or just a series of broken promises, a distracting, milestoneless blur? "The world's a mess; it's in my kiss," becomes "How did I get here? I don't recognise anyone." Some of the sweat we smell must be residue left by dead people. I shrink and shrug and words go soft as you take over and make sorrow our bond, and it hurts and it heals and it makes you even more beautiful to me. Nobody is responsible for your stumbling through unlit forests, for your becoming older and feeling forgotten. Someone may care, though, that you are out on your own; someone may be awake like you, worried like a wretched roadside recluse. We've hammered and torn each other; how can anyone speak or write or draw anything by hand or machine without taking what's left out - what vanishes - into account? How do we break away deafly from the miserable crying that dominates the air; how do we look away, look away, look away? There is no *HOWL*, no lesson, no "Watch me! Listen! I care!"

We human beings probably were not first to see holes in the sky, to support that all that open space might be empty space. I am, however, the only person I know who has even flown in seat 6-F of Iberia Flight 3166 at 18:58 hours Greenwich Mean Time, on the 27th of June 2005, heading west by northwest over the English Channel, nearing Portsmouth. At approximately 30,000 feet we are invisible to the naked human eye watching from the ground, perceiving us as blue nothing, I wonder, as I did at ages twenty and eight and earlier, who'd ever find me in the middle of the forest? Or if I'd want them to.

New contexts for old feelings, trusting the formation of sentences that may or may not take me anywhere, kind of like fishing or hoping to see wildlife: being present and making an effort. I wanted to die, and then I ate you. You came looking for me, and didn't get whatever you wanted. Guess no one wins staying inside. I've been on hundreds of planes, spent thousands of hours between times and places. We will land, and I won't be done writing about this and maybe other things. Most people in the world have never even touched a plane, much less conceived of flying in one. I am served the meat I smelled before seeing it. It is dark and dry on the outside. I cut into it and eat some, knowing it will be foul inside me.
