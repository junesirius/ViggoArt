Filling in crossword puzzles, marking calendars, fine-filing fingernails with diamond-cutter precision, snapping through shopping catalogues with the studied discernment earned by devouring mile-high stacks of immediately perishable publications. Scouring, dusting, polishing, trimming, plucking, folding, stacking, mopping, edging, weeding, combing, deleting, downloading, attaching, forwarding, shredding, creasing, greasing, blow-drying, weaving, sewing, knitting, baking, boiling, roasting, frying, poaching, freezing, rinsing, scrubbing, drying, draining, bleeding, blaming, tracing, surrounding, dividing, ambushing, sniping, snipping, snapping, stripping, zipping, burning, smoking, cradling, rocking, raising, tilling, planting, canning, shaving, trussing, stretching, strapping, stabbing, circumcising, stomping, gouging, slicing, rendering, suckling, soaking, levelling, sealing, sectioning, napping, evading, removing all evidence of struggle, discomfort, carnage, disposal, and leaving site thoroughly tidied for future use. This is how we pass the little time we have, what we do in our waking hours while we may or may not be dreaming, planning, rehashing, regretting, and occasionally feeling that we understand what in the world is happening.
