It is the first time you are late and I am not. I sit waiting on the limestone wall long after giving up expecting you, intent on last tenuous glint of fox eyes watching me from the shaley shore. My bedewed shoulders have begun to shiver. A familiar horizon hints greyly at reconfiguring itself as the fox glides uphill and pauses, silhourtted against the faint shimmer of what must be the river. Is he mesmerised, as I am, by the steady purgation of night, relieved at the prospect of illumination and warmth?

You an I have let things go wrong a little all the time lately, hoping they wouldn't go far wrong for long, which is as complicated as it sounds, Dawn comes quietly, though. No sight, sound, or scent could seem unlovely now. Feeling no hurry, I stand and slowly walk half-way down the dune that slopes away from the nearly buried wooden stairway, stopping to scan the horizon for the first glimpse of a rising sun. As another day creeps into view, I try to put last night's disappointments into some sort of order , already inventing the rest of the day, harvesting phrases and pictures to shore up my uncertain banks against a predictable tide of doubt. At least pissing on the sand brings a certain, uncluttered relief.

I've been peeing in sinks lately. I don't know why, and I don't remember the first time I did it by choice rather than necessity. It is only as a result of conscious effort that I use toilets anymore. I've always tended to urinate outside whenever that option presented itself, even in cities. There is something reassuring about standing on frosty ground, gazing up at the stars, for example, and letting myself flow, melting rime off the grass. Or pissing when it rains, in the sea, off a cliff, from a tree, on gravel, down an alley.

While urine has long been known to have disinfectant qualities, it is generally considered distinctly malodourous, and its mere mention does, by and large, provoke negative reactions. Stuck in traffic, I've several times counted myself lucky to have an empty bottle within reach to carefully empty my aching bladder into, but those urinary experiences have been driven by a need for urgent improvisation rather than by any whim. Spending a penny in sink, however, is a new outlet for me, and an operation that requires special care. Relieving oneself slowly is vital, angling the stream so as to reach the drain within minimal splashing. Thoroughly washing the sink afterwards is also the responsible way to go, out of consideration for the unsuspecting who may subsequently wash their hands or brush their teeth over it. Caution should also be taken not to dribble or drip at the very end, prior to doing up one's trousers and leaving, so as not to sully the floor. I believe that this method uses less water than flushing a toilet, although it cannot compare with the great outdoors, where little water is wasted but one's own.
