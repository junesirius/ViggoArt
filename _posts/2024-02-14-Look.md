Some people could look at a mud puddle and see an ocean with ships.

——Zora Neale Hurston

One touch of nature makes the whole world kin.

——William Shakespeare

Daily

before bed

for many years

then

again

early

before work

steal

time

witness

visible

moment

passing

shadow

exhale

blink

what rings out

however faintly

shouts

as it may

run outside

into weather

available

<br>

Stop

listen

view

perfections

wild and fragile

flawed

stunted

rampant

poisonous

doomed

decaying

bones

seeds

glimpsed

in last light

first light

nearly

no light

finite

lives

oblivious to your forgetfulness

resistant

busy

born

dying

take

the trouble

leave

road

ignore

schedules

and a thousand artificial encounters

<br>

Look

north

inhale

recognise

yourself

within

bloom and rot

frost and darkness

dust

catch

seedling dawn

thorn

bramble

cobweb

shocking green

garbage blooms

insect

trainls

purpose

bring

forth

untended

garden

provide

sustenance

shade

shelter

build

places

cavernous

or

minute

underfoot

as

beyond

reach

safe

dank

soft

to

perish

<br>

Silhouettes

fleeting

fly-bys

altered

wind

any

window

offers

every

moment

hear

smell

touch

feel

free

of judgment

lest

fated

to miss

most

changes

no matter

you're

still

here.
