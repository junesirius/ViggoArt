You found my keys

on an angel's hip,

moved half the fallen trees

from the frozen road.

<br>

This trip is

all I thought

it would be,

and we're not

even 1/2 way yet.

<br>

If I can't touch you

with snow-hung firs

our only witnesses,

can't have your eyes

when everyone's asleep,

then the fire's almost out.

<br>

You ask the un-named

attraction to leave town

but keep checking

if I'm still around.

<br>

Should we side-

step putting fingers to

words tracing lips that

would inform us?

<br>

Once said I'd missed

you every instant

before we'd met.

Now believe we knew

how sad we'd be

apart.

<br>

(1999-2000)
