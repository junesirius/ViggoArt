After driving the first forty miles of the day

you accused me of ignoring yo.

Now I am waiting for the next volley

but it isn't coming.

I've been thinking for an hour since

and I don't know what you meant.

All you probably wanted was to trade a few words.

I didn't.

My mind has been on road things.

I see that the ocotillo is greening,

the sage looks like new.

Crows everywhere.

Some of the washes are wet

and there's a three0day grass mantle

on the highway shoulders.

Even the cottonwoods show signs

of waking up.

But now that you have accused me

I don't feel like mentioning these things.

Or the roadkills.

Or the Colorado,

which we just crossed

as you born down on yet another postcard.

Maybe you're right,

maybe this silence is oppressive - 

indicating some great underlying disorder.

But the year has begun

and this car is running perfect.

<br>

(1990)
