Oceans take our secrets,

what we don't want to see or smell anymore.

We feel anonymous,

we feel clean

when we throw our past away.

It will wash, we think.

It will sink,

it will drift far from this shore.

It will disappear.

Maybe the fish will eat our words,

maybe lost or spurned loves

will help deep-sea feathery green plants grow.

<br>

Now and again

I find myself walking on the wet, hard-packed sand

looking for tears and exotic messages

in the creeping, reaching water

that just misses touching my toes.

Sometimes there's something clear and obvious

like a fingernail or a plastic bag,

though I'll never know for sure

who threw them away.

Once I found a wedding ring,

uncovered by the receding tide.

I didn't touch it,

I was already married.

<br>

(1991)
