Medicated limbs, lonely and greedy. Sick for attention, dying for company, you're drunk for days. Overburdened, moss-rotten branches heave slowly with the weak night breeze, like a failing heart, and graze the stone wall.

The nurse in me won't let me leave.

Homemade illness hardens into sugar and batters your speech, draping your dry white tongue over your teeth. Red pinholes for eyes, and your mouth is a smudge.

Do I have to watch tomorrow afternoon while you keep your face warm with the television and the maple drips on the lawn chairs that flake and rust on the flooded terrace?

When you start snoring, I'll take the tray from your lap and tip you over so I can look for the rest of your lunch under the green sofa cushions and probably find those pills you've been hiding. By the time the clouds dim and I start seeing us in the windows, I'll be drunk myself and ready to wake you for dinner.

(1985)
