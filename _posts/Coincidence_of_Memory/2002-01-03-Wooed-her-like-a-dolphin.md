Wooed her like a dolphin,

treats her like tune.

She blackens, tries experiencing

nothing. He looks for her

without touching, makes pinpricks

in her furtive nakedness,

like a hyena.

<br>

Flooded plains may remind her

of startled fish, sunken palaces

lit by moons and moons.

He does not know what she's

thinking, doesn't know what's worse:

believing she's come straight

from heaven or nowhere

at all.

<br>

She is willing to continue

feeding him himself; calls that

living on her own terms,

sage in houses they promise

to build each other with

views on every side and

enough curtain to sleep

through it all.

(1996)
