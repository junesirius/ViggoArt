### 1.

Red-eyes, chore laden

and stooped with grudges

they scratch on the sheepridges

with their bleached sticks,

knuckles flaring in the cold

and pick a living from the sand.

<br>

There are no seducers

no bowls of fruit carved from teak.

Shards of bone china

are occasionally exposed

in the eroding cliffs,

stubborn testaments

to hopeful Sunday evenings

frozen faithful and waiting

for spring.

The only thing green

is the now scurrying,

now stone-still lizard,

son of the permanent footprints

that mark fitful starts

to invisible paths

in the bankrupt riverbed.

<br>

### 2.

The women crawl

with unvarying pulses

bearing rusting pails

of discarded shale

for sleepwalking husbands

with hands that dream

of skinning fish

after tearing entrails

from supple young spines.

<br>

### 3.

There are no children,

only younger versions

of those nearly done.

Good likenesses

of the same lack

of a warm side

of the same limited repertoire

of mannerisms

of the same inflexibility

of lifespans.
