Am I as gone as October

at this table, two

from the one we talked

at for hours of plans

for summer and rivers,

where I marvelled at

the new mystery just

inches of white linen

away?

<br>

You are still present,

dressed warmer than

necessary, tame enough

to be understood, to

say that you too are

curious about how

we might go places.

The waiter looms,

inadvertently breaking

the news that you're

really back home, perhaps

in a relieved apron state

that may fit you just fine,

for all I ever knew.

<br>

(2000-02)
