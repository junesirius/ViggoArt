I first heard your voice from an airplane. You told me you had crystal knees and couldn't stop thinking about Jean Seberg's foetus baby in its glass coffin to prove it wasn't black at all. I wanted to hang up or politely say goodbye and then change my number and never answer the phone again until I knew you were dead. But you kept saying things I wanted to hear, like that a window might as well be a wall but thank god for fish tanks and bottles.

(1995)
