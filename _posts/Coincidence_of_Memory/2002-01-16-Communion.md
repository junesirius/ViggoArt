### 1.

We've left shore somehow,

become the friends

of early theory,

close enough to speak

desire and pain of absence,

of mistakes we'd make

given the chance.

<br>

Each smile returned

makes harder avoiding

dreams that see us

lying in early evening

curtain shadows, skin

safe against skin.

Bloom of compassion,

respect for moments

eyes lock turns

forever into one more

veil that falls away.

<br>

### 2.

This after seeing you

last night, first time

smelling you with

permission: shoulders to

wonder openly at,

as carefully kissed

as those arms

waited impossibly on.

They've held me now,

and your breath

down my back

sent away night air

that had me shaking

in the unlit anglican

doorway.

<br>

### 3.

Are we ruined for

finding our faces lit

and want to know more

about morning? Is

friendship cancelled

if we can't call

each other anymore

in amnesia, invite

ourselves to last glances

under suspicious clocks

telling us when we've

had enough?

<br>

### 4.

Your steady hands

cradling my grateful

skull: were you taking

in my face to

save an image

you've rarely allowed

yourself after leaving

that cold alcove?

Am I a photograph

you gaze at in

moments of weakness?

<br>

You ordered me

off my knees,

into your arms.

Wasn't to beg

that I knelt; only

to see you once

from below.

<br>

Tried to say something

that filled my mouth

and longed to rest

in your ear.

Don't dare write

it down for fear it'll

become words, just

words.

<br>

(1999-2002)
