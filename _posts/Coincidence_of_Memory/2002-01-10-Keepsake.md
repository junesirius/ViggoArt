Still unused,

the letter opener

she got on her birthday

has become tarnished.

It lies on the sill,

next to a seashell

she found in Florida

before moving west.

Before becoming a writer.

Before becoming a mother.

Her son wants to use it

as a dagger, to

wield it savagely

against monsters

streaming from toy-

cluttered corners

of his room,

but he can't

reach it yet.

(1991)
