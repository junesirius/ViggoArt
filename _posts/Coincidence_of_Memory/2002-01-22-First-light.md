### 1.

Even now, out of

radio range and time,

you advance, insistent,

aglow. Wet forelock

exactly where it fell

across your reddened brow,

eyes lit and daring

all comers. Mostly,

though, I remember

you keeping a

mingling distance

as the company grew

and began to sway

around three or

four in the afternoon.

<br>

My hands have healed

and still reach through

moonless dawn for

your nape, clavicle, crow's

feet, eyelids as I drive

into your green country. 

Reminders appear like

lines of frost as sun

reaches steering wheel

and raspy coffee consonants

start piercing static.

Torn knuckles sealed,

making less of wounds

I'll not forget as easily

as you forgot to write.

You pushed my arms 

out from our hops, bloody

paws suspended, flopping

to make the only breeze in

the valley. Can what's now

freely given be acceptable, 

the uncluttered embrace

of another welcomes as

your echo unravels?

<vr>

I've traversed clotheslines

sagging in dewlight to see

your candles, to kneel on

pavement and hold out

notes left trapped

on my windshield,

folded over twice for

privacy, eagerly and often

re-read. The possible scent

of your careless hand

scribbling, of thumb

dragging, easily opening

my mouth for anything

you wish me to swallow.

<br>

### 2.

And you, little god: do

you avoid burning finger

tips when shielding moths

from your bedside light?

Can you keep your father's 

heart sage under your 

pillow? Will you soon

wonder why I didn't warn

you well enough how 

it would hurt to lose

your petals and grow

scars on your hands?

<br>

(1999-2002)
