Moths are being burnt tonight, halfway into the late shift, by men propped up with cigarettes. Smoke ribbons unfurl in the harsh fluorescent light and disappear in a twinkling blizzard of metal and choking bugs that hides the ceiling. The younger men calculate how much more money they'll make for not sleeping this week. The older men roll the cigarettes. One man consoles the other by staying awake, covering for him when the naps on the toilet, away from the foreman's blue eye. There are coffee pot holes, and the gravelly work floor sparkles with scratchy rag-lung spit spots pumped out by black-blooded heart muscle. At dawn they let the showers run until the water is good and warm, so as not to startle themselves when they step in to wash the dust from their grey hair and skin.

(1979)
