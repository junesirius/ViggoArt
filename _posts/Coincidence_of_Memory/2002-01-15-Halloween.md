They were always giving birth, always pregnant, always taking fucking for granted. They were not being brave when they dug up the skulls of their past lovers in the middle of the night and painted them for use as Jack O'Lanterns. It was summer and they were crazy about each other.

In the past week the weather has turned bad and they've stuffed a sheet into the stovepipe to keep out the wind. It is torn and bloodstained from the time he convalesced on it after tearing up his ankle in a motorcycle accident. It smells of that time, of arnica and sweat. They need more than a sheet to remember what bound them. They need wood for the stove. Lately, they've been fighting over those heads, wanting to know whose was whose. She's been splitting them with the kindling axe when the kids have fallen asleep and he is taking his evening bath. Up to his ears in oily bubbles, he hears the bone splintering, as well as the occasional bad swing that takes a divot out of the rotten floorboards of the back porch, and thinks it's probably good exercise. He remembers standing holding hands with her outside their locked car, keys visible in moon-light on the front sear: freezing on the prairie, laughing at themselves.

(1990)
