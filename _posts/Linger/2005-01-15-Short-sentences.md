Am farbigen Abglanz haben wir das Leben

——Goethe

Among coloured reflections is our life.

(translation by VM)

<br>

death will come, always out of season

——Black Elk

<br>

Te veo como si aún estuvieras sentada a mi lado. Te oiré hasta que olvide porque no te quise más este invierno. Guardo el peine que dejaste, la miel que curó tu herida, y la perla negra de mi duda.

<br>

(Self-translation and reference from *Winter Songs*:)

I see you as though you were still sitting next to me. I will hear you until I forget why I didn't love you more this winter. I keep the comb you left behind, the honey that healed your wound, and the black pearl of my doubt.

<br>

The human shape is a ghost

made of distraction and pain.

Sometimes pure light, sometimes cruel,

trying wildly to open,

this image tightly held within itself.

——Rumi

<br>

Junio: Tengo un libro lleno de frases incompletas. El sol: blanco, hecho de seda vieja.

(Translation from *Winter Songs*:)

June: I have a book full of unfinished phrases. The sun: white, made of old silk.

<br>

When the soul of a man is born in this country there are nets flung at it to hold it back from flight. You talk of nationality, language, religion. I shall try to fly by those nets.

——James Joyce

<br>

Don't be bitter.

You drew a moon,

and now you miss the day.

<br>

... I feel that people are like trees that move, trees that have lost their roots and are always in search of the soil.

——Gyrðir Elíasson

<br>

Can you join, ask sincerely for affection

without sweaty hand of expectation,

understanding and accepting

if it never is given?

<br>

Que te dejen seguir soñando, y que te perdonen

el haberte caido sin fijarte por donde salía tu alma.

Supiste vivir, y nadie te contó que no sería para siempre.

Sigo acá, de momento, hasta cuando sea.

(Self-translation:)

That they let you continue dreaming, and that they

forgive you for having fallen without noticing where your soul came out.

You knew how to live, and nobody told you that it wouldn't be forever.

I'm still here, for now, until whenever.
