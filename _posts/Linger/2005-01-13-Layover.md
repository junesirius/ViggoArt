Hotel guest cleans mirrors in the air-conditioned hum of three or four in the morning. Closes drapes, hangs socks from showerhead to hopefully drip dry by dawn. Forgot toothbrush; can't buy another now, will sleep with rotten breath until terminal shops open. Can imagine Sweden across foggy runway, toils back through names and pulses dug up and nearly felt anew. Impression of one who saw him off last spring. Looks up through blue light, past headboard to safety sprinkler on ceiling. Pictures the next island, sees another incomplete set of gestures, kindles undefined anticipation of nearly answered wish. Asks to live a little longer, surprised by the hoarseness of his whisper, hoping the woman will wait.
