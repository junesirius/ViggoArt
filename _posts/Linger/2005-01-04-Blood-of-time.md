A house, like any house, built to hold future dreaming. New cupboard, chests, beds, windowsills, sinks, shelves, and toilets: vehicles of largely unfounded optimism, of blind hope - perhaps  the best kind. Though these things are hard to come by, I no longer aspire to bear the weight of their expectation, or spill more than my share of time's blood. To me these vessels seem like snares that I'm unwilling or unready to enter, and I'd gratefully relinquish them to the service of others. This impulse may only be a futile, short-lived turning away from ends I cannot escape, as I persist in breathing ruin all day, inhaling new whispers and tainting myself with familiar smoke. Memory of past exhalations presses on my waking thoughts - comeuppance for surviving this long, for living on my own. Soon I'll have to break down scaffolding I've always assumed was temporary, to leave only what might stand up to the weather and speak for itself when I am gone. It would be ideal to stand still, removed enough to see what could happen next. As a boy, I knew my body and understood it was not mine. My conscience is not clean, and I fear further reconstruction. I'll try to make more amends but only feel capable of imagining ways of breathing more easily in order to say good-bye and make no new promises.
