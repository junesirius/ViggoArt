Go hear same song all places time allows echo to fail.

Landscapes show us why we might stay or stay away.

<br>

Gull fixed high over fjord won't sleep all summer long.

We'll wait like her for dark's return to mend our nests.

<br>

final gleam on tucked wings rivals midnight's rainbow.

She pierces skerry-riffle silver spawn on green gravel.

<br>

Cliffside shale fills side mirror in broken downhill skid.

Strain and see wheel sunk in moss so deep it's lost.
