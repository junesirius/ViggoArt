Listen to the way she chews her food, the force of her devouring. Healthy teeth, horse-jaw elegance. She looks up as she swallows, caught by the unwavering accusation in our sharp young eyes.

I remember riding behind her, through the stirrup-high razor grass, around giant anthills, as battalions of mosquitoes hovered over the switching tail of her irritated mare. Is she in Chicago? Did she remarry? Is her hair grey? Does she still read French novels? Is she still tall and skinny? Does she still ride? Was she in love with my father? Was he in love with her?

Hacking trail for us, he leads the way through thickets of soaking green monkey brush, calling out animal hideaways and bringing home pieces of crude botanical conjecture with lazy hacks of his vine-stained machete.
