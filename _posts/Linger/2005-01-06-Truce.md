Sore arm in sunshine on dirt driveway cracks loud and painful at the shoulder when you pull yourself up the sandstone archway into a sit and view of scab-knuckled hands resting in lap, seeming dead but for slow swell of blue veins and pale hairs rising against the chill breeze. Back and knees will not forget to settle old scores every wishful waking hour from now on.
