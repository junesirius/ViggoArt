For three or four months, I have visited the corner where we sometimes used to meet for breakfast - though it is now far our of my usual way - just to see your blood. That stain is no longer a  topic of conversation even incidentally among our few remaining friends I occasionally come across. It blackened over the summer, picking up tyre prints and a pigeon feather, asphalt cooking up into it and joining you as it might a flattened wad of gum. The last time I went to see, you had so blended with the street that it took me a few minutes to find the familiar outline. No need to keep looking for the essence of what I've assumed to be our shared memory and fading connection. I may sometimes think to cast a passing glance at the spot on rare occasions I find myself walking up that street, but will no longer stop and kneel to look for the right light to catch you in.
