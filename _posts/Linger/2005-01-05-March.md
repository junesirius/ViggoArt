Movies memories are made of. Music that rises, breaks away from its source, hovers over wet, empty streets. Unmanageable echo of places we really live in. I picture a face, blizzard-bit: one of many images never captured, one more missed opportunity to exploit and order the growing past. Have surrendered to unavoidable cave-ins caused by sentence upon sentence, given in to ideas that freely resolve themselves and run through buckled walls, downed fences, and thawing pack ice. What seem like lucid glimpses sparkling inside untutored lapses only confirm value of trying nothing, saying nothing, solving nothing. Last notes float down Bay Street at day's end, and beginning of another. I answer neither murmur from ceiling vent, not wail of lightbulbs pulling heat from buried wires, nor moan of pigeon-toed parquet fir settling its brutal joins in waxed rows as it cramps its way into corner shadows. Hallway's quiet. Phone waits, warns.
