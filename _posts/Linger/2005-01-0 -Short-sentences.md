Am farbigen Abglanz haben wir das Leben

——Goethe

Among coloured reflections is our life.

(translation by VM)

<br>

death will come, always out of season

——Black Elk

<br>

Te veo como si aún estuvieras sentada a mi lado. Te oiré hasta que olvide porque no te quise más este invierno. Guardo el peine que dejaste, la miel que curó tu herida, y la perla negra de mi duda.

<br>

(Self-translation and reference from *Winter Songs*:)

I see you as though you were still sitting next to me. I will hear you until I forget why I didn't love you more this winter. I keep the comb you left behind, the honey that healed your wound, and the black pearl of my doubt.

<br>

The human shape is a ghost

made of distraction and pain.

Sometimes pure light, sometimes cruel,

trying wildly to open,

this image tightly held within itself.

——Rumi

<br>

Junio: Tengo un libro lleno de frases incompletas. El sol: blanco, hecho de seda vieja.

(Translation from *Winter Songs*:)

June: I have a book full of unfinished phrases. The sun: white, made of old silk.

<br>

When the soul of a man is born in this country there are nets flung at it to hold it back from flight. You talk of nationality, language, religion. I shall try to fly by those nets.

——James Joyce

<br>

Don't be bitter.

You drew a moon,

and now you miss the day.
