I could not bring myself to take pictures of any of it, to take anything, although I did for a moment consider grabbing my camera to ensure that later on I'd have an image, some tangible visual record of the process of losing you. Maybe that momentary impulse came from fear that the emotional wright of participating in your last days as flesh-and-blood would eventually outweigh or alter the straight facts that photographs might hold. Fear that visuals so fresh right then, as I sat on one of the two plush green leather couches of the crematorium waiting room, would reshuffle themselves and gently blend together as merely tolerable sentimental recollection. It wouldn't have been right, though, to shoot what only you and I should know. The camera stayed in the truck.

The kind man in charge of the ovens had just gone out into the noon blast of July in the San Fernando Valley to check on the progress of your burning. I'd followed but stopped thirty feet back as he'd asked me to.

"You don't really want to see - it's something you probably wouldn't want to see... The... uh..., " he'd mumbled, faltering in a way that had won me over instantly.

"You mean if she isn't done yet?" I'd said, completing the thought for him.

"Yes, exactly. The, uh... sometimes they're not completely... " He'd paused, looking as pained as if he'd known you the way I had.

"Her insides?"

"Yes," he'd blurted out with a slight squeak in his voice, "It isn't pretty."

"No. I can imagine it wouldn't be." I'd said.

"Not at all pretty."

He had stood there, putting on his fire-retardant gloves and his sunglasses, still looking at me as if needing to say something more. And I had waited. It'd already been a hell of a long morning, so I hadn't been in any big hurry at that point.

"I do this all the time, but I couldn't personally, you know, do this."

I'd thought I understood more or less what he meant.

"My uncle's dog," he'd continued, "I had to do that one, and it was very difficult. I could never do it again."

"I understand." I'd said.

"Very difficult."

"Yes, I'm sure."

He'd started backing sideways toward the oven. It was one of the three on the back lot that seemed to be in operation, as evidenced by the grey smoke rising from their steel-pipe smokestacks into the smoggy haze above us. As inappropriate as the thoughts might have been, I somehow couldn't help think of the much larger indoor ones I'd once seen in the Dachau concentration camp memorial. I'd felt a momentary urge to ask if these ovens had been manufactured in Europe, but it had passed.

"Please stay back here while I check and see how she's doing," he'd then said.

"OK," I'd said. "And how do you check?"

He'd stopped side stepping toward the oven. "I open the door and look."

"Oh. Yeah."

"She might not be done. She might not be ready."

"Yeah. OK. I'll wait..."

"Plus, it's real hot. About 1,500 degrees."

"I'll wait here then."

"I'm so sorry," he'd said, tugging down the bill of his navy-blue ball cap and turning toward the oven. He'd said "sorry" several times since I'd arrived, and he seemed to mean it. "Sorry for your loss. I am truly sorry."

After a minute spent carefully peeking through the slightly opened oven door, he'd closed it and walked back to me. "I'm sorry. She's not done yet. Another ten or fifteen minutes."

"Should I go back inside to the waiting room, then?"

"Yes. If you don't mind. Sorry. I'll let you know just before I get her so you can come and watch me do everything. Check, you know, to see if... see that... "

"Yeah, good. OK, thanks."

A tall, well-groomed black poodle named Paris, as I'd overheard her being called when I'd first arrived at the crematorium office, had been staring at me for a while. From her position under as a sort of anarmic-looking potted ficus by the doorway to the office, she was able to monitor all comings and goings. Suddenly, she rose and bolted straight for me, jumping up on the couch right next to me, backing excitedly. Her breath smelled like boiled carrots. Sort of sweet and not altogether unpleasant, but not something I craved at that moment. The receptionist called Paris, no doubt trying to keep the dog from further upsetting me, the grieving customer. Paris was not bothering me at all. I understood that she had been barking for attention, not out of aggression - probably bored out of her mind in this place where all other dogs were dead and burning or about to be. She hadn't even barked that loudly, really, and her company was comforting in a life-goes-on-and-there-are-lots-of-nice-dogs-in-the-world-sort-of-way. Paris gave me one more quieter bark right in my left ear, licked my face, and left me to see what the receptionist wanted.

"I'm very sorry," the receptionist said, as she led Paris into the back of the office area.

"That's OK," I said. "She wasn't bothering me. Female, right?"

"Yes, she certainly is. I am sorry for your loss."

I know she meant it as well. Expressions of sympathy for the customer would to some degree have probably been obligatory for the cremantorium personnel, but everyone did seem to be personally and genuinely concerned. People doing their utmost to run a decent family-owned business with kindness and compassion. The compulsion to record all of this got the better of me, finally, and I went out to the truck to look for my notebook. After a quick scramble through the papers, books, cameras and other assorted commuter debris on the back seat, I found the notebook. Although I had not had the time to take many pictures or to sit down and write much of anything lately, a camera and something to write in are always in the car, or in whatever bag I carry, just in case a moment special to me presents itself to be stolen. Resisting once more the temptation to take the camera, I grabbed the notebook and a pen and returned to the waiting room to begin writing this.

Kind strangers have given me a few handsomely bound journals and notebooks over the years. Some, like this one, are bound in beautifully tanned and tooled leather. This one's cover has a giant oak tree cut into it, with other old oaks on a distant ridge beyond it. The big pewter button used for typing the notebook closed with a leather thong is cast with an oak leaf and acorn detail. I am not much good at keeping a diary, or diligent about any sort of regular journal entries. My way to remember has usually been to write stories, poems, or more often than not, to make photographs or drawings. I felt a little rusty and awkward writing in the waiting root under the quierly watchful eyes of the receptionist and Paris. Maybe it didn't seem at all odd to them, my scribbling away. Probably what bothered me was my own sense of guilt over being inclined to record the events surrounding the processing of your body. Just a short time earlier I had been openly weeping while crossing the city in morning rush-hours traffic. I suppose we humans can be resilient - nearly as resilient as you were, Brigit - and as accepting of life's unpredictably rough patches as most animals seem to be. Whatever the reason, I found I could not write fast enough in my attempt to describe the events of the day.

"Do you want to come out while I clean this out?" the kind voice of the oven-minder asked softly, interrupting me in mid-sentence. I looked up and nodded.

"Yes, please. I'll... let me... let me just finish this sentence - this paragraph. I'll be right there."

"Sure..."

<p style="text-align: center; text-indent: 0;">*</p>

"Do you write a lot?", he asked, as I followed him outside.

"Used to."

"Nice-looking book you got there."

"Thanks. Yes, it is."

I closed it, marking my place with the pen, just as he stopped and turned to me. I was standing on the same spot I had been asked to watch from earlier.

"Please stay right here. I'll shut her down and get everything. You'll be able to see everything happening, but it is very hot now, and also... "

"Yes, ok I'll wait here."

As I stood still in the by now withering heat and watched him switch off the oven and open it, I suddenly realised that there had been no muzak, no music of any kind playing in the waiting room. That was a pleasant surprise and seemed remarkable to me. The tact involved in such a choice on their part told me that they really must care.

The ovens were out behind the small, one-story building that holds the ridy crematorium office, some oversize freezers, and the very pleasant, air-conditioned waiting room. The property was surrounded by twenty-foot-high stacks of automobile carcasses, entire auto bodies and an enormous variety of neatly sorted bits and pieces - fenders, doors, hoods, seats, side mirrors, steering mechanisms, engine parts, dashboards, roofs, etc., arranged in row after row - apparently according to year, make, and model. The sprawling salvage yeard dwarfed the crematorium and its modest parking lot. Although there was no vegetation in sight, the colourful, encroaching heaps and rows of rendered vehicles almost looked like exotic organic growth, a sort of postmortem environment that seemed to me to perfectly complement the pet-burning business. The thick, lightly buzzing strands of heavy-duty power lines drooping as they crossed some thirty feet above us from one massive steel support to another only added to this entirely man-made, and re-made, end-of-nature garden. Its perfume was a blend of acrid and oily-sweet, of melting rubber and asphalt, of taffy-thick black engine grease, of yellowing plastic and peeling paint sluggishly wafting upward and blending with the constant dead-fish reek of Los Angeles smog.

I had risen very early - or, rather, got out of bed early, as I hadn't slept at all. Knowing it was today that I was scheduled to pick up your refrigerated corpse at our trustworthy local veterinary hospital and drive it our to this industrial hinterland for cremeting had kept me from being able to rest. Probably I am able to write about this with a degree of detachment because your brother Henry and I have already gone through the worst of your final decay and death process together. We took you, our fifteen-year-old completely lame and largely incontinent pal, to be "put down" three days ago. In the intervening time we had to wait for a slot at the crematorium to open up. I have been able to largely digest and assimilate the stronger surface emotions of your final morning. As much as I am and will continue to be haunted by your sweet, departing gaze when the brain-stopping serum was administered, time and the responsibilities resulting from your passing have more or less carried me away from that heartbreaking scene. I will always see your eyes slowly lose their gleam as I gently lay your head down. Will always remember your final generous gesture of rolling halfway over to let us rub your belly one last time before the doctor gave you the sedative.

I'd arrived at the back door of the vet's office feeling like I was complicit in some sort of underworld transaction. As had been the case all week, the morning sky was overcast, and the clammy grey marine layer had only added to the death business I was now part of. Two men in overalls had come our with what looked enough like a curled-up "you" shape inside a light-blue trash bag. As I had taken the thawing bundle and carefully laid it on the towel-covered passenger seat of the pickup truck, I had looked at the older of the two men. He'd nodded, seeming a bit uncomfortable, and then had turned and followed his colleague back inside the building without a backward glance or farewell. I had been very tired, a bit teary-eyed, and had not said a word myself. Probably not the most pleasant person for them to be around. I had got in the car and begun making my way to the 405 freeway. Moving slowly, stuck in the usual massive commuter caravan headed north toward the Sepulveda Pass, it had occurred to me that tomorrow would mark the 60th anniversary of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki atomic bomb drops. Then I had thought, not for the first time when passing the Sunset Boulevard exit, about O.J. Simpson's bizarre televised journey in the famous white Ford Bronco. I had continued in that vein for a while, my mind becoming cluttered with a dizzying assortment of images involving unforgivable murders and other perversions of justice. The ideals of compassion had seemed distant, insignificant. I'd felt resigned, passively understanding that life moves forward just as traffic eventually does. Suddenly, the cars in front of me had slowed abruptly and I had braked hard, glad to see cars in my rear-view mirror doing the same. The bagged corpse had slid off the seat and onto the floor, and I'd tried to pull it back up with my right hand. It had been quite heavy, and I'd realised it would be a difficult and dangerous task to accomplish while driving, so I had made my way across two lanes of traffic and off onto the side of the freeway. As I had come round the front of the truck and opened the passenger-side door, I had decided I'd have a look at you to see if you were intact. I had straightened out the towel on the seat and lifted the bundle back onto it, then poked a hole in the plastic bag, now wet with condensation, where I could feel onr of your frozen paws. Long black hair, long black nails. Not much like any of your paws. I had quickly felt for the body's head, finding a stiff tongue projecting beyond clenched teeth, and then a collar around the neck. We had taken your collar off when you'd expired at the vet's, and I knew that Henry was wearing it weapped twice around his wrist as a bracelet today. This dog was not you. The absurdity of it all had hit me immediately as I had stood up and stared at the mass of moving cars through the poisonous-looking heat waves. The sadness of it had been suddenly overwhelming, as was the smell of initial decomposition, which I had not been aware of until that moment, like that of a dead eer that's been hanging for a few hours from a tree.

I had never really wanted to live in Los Angeles. Here I was, on yet another ridiculous errand, feeling vaguely like I was being punished for some past transgression, marking time and forced to make sense of an oddly evolving riddle. I had secured the corpse and made sure the towel was placed so as to keep the dead stranger from touching the seat of any part of the truck's interior. Eventually, I'd got myself turned around and headed back to the vet's, feeling sorry for this poor dog I did not know, and for its unwitting owner. En route, I had called the crematorium and informed them that I would be late for our oven appointment because I'd been given the wrong dog. They'd been very kind, had said I should get there when I could, and that they were very sorry.

<p style="text-align: center; text-indent: 0;">*</p>

Now the crematorium is about two miles behind me as I sit listlessly sipping coffee at a Mexican restaurant. This is as far as I have got, with my new cedar box containing your remaining bone fragments and ashes. I had asked the oven-minder to please not crush your bones if that was what he'd planned on doing.

"Yes, normally we do very gently break down the bone metter so that it fits comfortably in the box or urn as the case might be. If you prefer, though..."

"Yes."

"... we can also not do it and just try and place her, the bone matter - the bag, that is - in the cedar box for you. If they'll fit - if it will fit - that is."

"That's ok, I can do it."

Earlier, out by the ovens, I had been allowed to scoop up all your burnt bits from the metal tray that the man had scratched the cooling, fragile ghost shape of your skeleton onto. I had stopped several times to carefully examine some of your more distinguishable pieces. Vertebrae, hip parts, and, most beautiful of all, the rounded piece of bone that I instantly recognised as the top of your skull. We have petted that part of you so often. I can feel its shape evennow, in memory, feel the bone through your smooth fur, feel your warmth and your happiness. All of it had gone into the plastic bag he now held.

"Ok, sir. As you prefer."

I proceeded to gently rearrange the bag and its contents inside the box, and then placed your crematorium nametag and the receipt for services provided on top of your remains before closing the lid with its little brass clasp.

"We would like you to consider the cedar box a gift from us due to the unfortunate mistake that was made this morning. We are very sorry about that."

"Oh. Well... thank you..."

A woman who seemed to be the oven-minder's boss, and perhaps the owner of the establishment, stood up and came around her desk to address me.

"We are very sorry that... Brigit?... that Brigit got confused this morning."

I almost pointed out that you had not been confused at all, being quite dead, but I resisted the temptation, knowing what she meant.

"It is very unusual that something unheard of like that would happen," she continued. "Very unusual, and we are extremely sorry. If you prefer a larger box or don't like cedar as a wood type... maybe an urn would be more to your liking?"

I was truly moved by her words and the generous offer.

"Is it Western Red cedar?" I asked, for some reason unknown to me now - perhaps being at a loss for anything better to say by way of response.

"You know, I am not real sure about that," she replied, a bit thrown off by my question. "I certainly can try and find out for you, if you like?"

"No, thanks. I wasjust wondering. Just curious, I guess."

"Would you like to replace the cedar?"

"Replace? No. I like cedar. Smells good, looks good. Thank you." I now felt like a complete idiot. "You don't have to give me the box, though. Don't have to give it... I'm happy to pay for it."

"We insist. It's something we want to do for you."

"Thank you very much. Very kind of you."

"If Brigit doesn't fit comfortably, not being completely dust and all..."

("comfortably?" Never mind...) "No, that's fine. She fits. I got her in there ok. And it's a beautiful box. Thank you."

<p style="text-align: center; text-indent: 0;">*</p>

"Me podría traer un poco de arroz con frijoles, por favor?"

"Would you like anything else with that?" the waitress replied, in heavily Spanish-accented English.

"Gracias, pero la verdad es queno tengo mucho hambre."

She looked at me calmly, and said "I'll bring it right out. Warm up your coffee for you?"

"Fijese: ahora que lo pienso creo que sí me gustaría una pequeña ensalada de lechuga y tomate... y cebolla, si hay."

"Ok," she continued in English, "and will you like some dressing - vinaigrette, ranch, French, blue cheese, or oil and vinegar - for that?"

Doesn't happen often, but once in a while my gringo looks or perhaps my Argentine accent seem to be held against me like that. She glances at the cedar box resting on the table to the right of my place setting. I wonder if she has seen this sort of box before. The crematorium isn't far, and maybe other people stop here now and then as I have, unable ot unwilling to drive any further. Maybe they somtimes come here and get a little drunk, become indiscreet and open their boxes to look at what's left of their animal friends. Maybe they cry and have to be consoled. I do not look at my box, just hold the waitress' gaze when it returns to me. I've taken an initial dislike to her because she seems to refuse to speak Spanish with me, so I'm certainly not going to give her any more clues now.

"Will that be all, sir?" she asks drily.

"Sí... y si me puede traer la cuenta con la comida - y un poco más de café - se lo agradecería."

She looks at me for a moment longer, than reluctantly mutters "Por supuesto, señor," as she turns to go place my order.
