I could not bring myself to take pictures of any of it, to take anything, although I did for a moment consider grabbing my camera to ensure that later on I'd have an image, some tangible visual record of the process of losing you. Maybe that momentary impulse came from fear that the emotional wright of oarticipating in your last days as flesh-and-blood would eventually outwrigh or alter the straight facts that photographs might hold. Fear that visuals so fresh right then, as I sat on one of the two plush green leather couches of the crematorium waiting room, would reshuffle themselves and gently blend together as merely tolerable sentimental recollection. It wouldn't have been right, though, to shoot what only you and I should know. The camera stayed in the truck.

The kind man in charge of the ovens had just gone out into the noon blast of July in the San Fernando Valley to check on the progress of your burning. I'd followed but stopped thirty feet back as he'd asked me to.

"You don't really want to see - it's something you probably wouldn't want o see... The... uh..., " he'd mumbled, faltering in a way that had won me over instantly.

"You mean if she isn't done yet?" I'd said, completing the thought for him.

"Yes, exactly. The, uh... sometimes they're not completely... " He'd paused, looking as pained as if he'd known you the way I had.

"Her insides?"

"Yes," he'd blurted out with a slight squeak in his voice, "It isn't pretty."

"No. I can imagine it wouldn't be." I'd said.

"Not at all pretty."

He had stood there, putting on his fire-retardant gloves and his sunglasses, still looking at me as if needing to say something more. And I had waited. It'd already been a hell of a long morning, so I hadn't been in any big hurry at that point.

"I do this all the time, but I couldn't personally, you know, do this."

I'd thought I understood more or less what he meant.

"My uncle's dog," he'd continued, "I had to do that one, and it was very difficult. I could never do it again."

"I understand." I'd said.

"Very difficult."

"Yes, I'm sure."

He'd started backing sideways toward the oven. It was one of the three on the back lot that seemed to be in operation, as evidenced by the grey smoke rising from their steel-pipe smokestacks into the smoggy haze above us. As inappropriate as the thoughts might have been, I somehow couldn't help think of the much larger inddor ones I'd once seen in the Dachau concentration camp memorial. I'd felt a momentary urge to ask if these ovens had been manufactured in Europe, but it had passed.

"Please stay back here while I check and see how she's doing," he'd then said.

"OK," I'd said. "And how do you check?"

He'd stopped side stepping toward the oven. "I open the dorr and look."

"Oh. Yeah."

"She might not be done. She might not be ready."

"Yeah. OK. I'll wait..."

"Plus, it's real hot. About 1,500 degrees."

"I'll wait here then."

"I'm so sorry," he'd said, tugging down the bill of his navy-blue ball cap and turning toward the oven. He'd said "sorry" several times since I'd arrived, and he seemed to mean it. "Sorry for your loss. I am truly sorry."

After a minut spent carefully peeking through the slightly opened oven door, he'd closed it and walked back to me. "I'm sorry. She's not done yet. Another ten or fifteen minutes."

"Should I go back inside to the waiting room, then?"

"Yes. If you don't mind. Sorry. I'll let you know just before I get her so you can come and watch me do everything. Check, you know, to see if... see that... "

"Yeah, good. OK, thanks."

A tall, well-groomed black poodle named Paris, as I'd overheard her being called when I'd first arrived at the crematorium office, had been staring at me for a while. From her position under as a sort of anarmic-looking potted ficus by the doorway to the office, she was able to monitor all comings and goings. Suddenly, she rose and bolted straight for me, jumping up on the couch right next to me, backing excitedly. Her breath smelled like boiled carrots. Sort of sweet and not altogether unpleasant, but not something I craved at that moment. The receptionist called Paris, no doubt trying to keep the dog from further upsetting me, the grieving customer. Paris was not bothering me at all. I understood that she had been barking for sttention, not out of aggression - probably bored out of her mind in this place where all other dogs were dead and burning or about to be. She hadn't even barked that loudly, really, and her company was comforting in a life-goes-on-and-there-are-lots-of-nice-dogs-in-the-world-sort-of-way. Paris gave me one more quierer bark right in my left ear, licked my face, and left me to see what the receptionist wanted.

"I'm very sorry," the receptionist said, as she led Paris into the back of the office area.

"That's OK," I said. "She wasn't bothering me. Female, right?"

"Yes, she certainly is. I am sorry for your loss."

I know she meant it as well. Expressions of sympathy for the customer would to some degree have probably been obligatory for the cremantorium personnel, but everyone did seem to be personally and genuinetly concerned. People doing their utmost to run a decent family-owned business with kindness and compassion. The compulsion to record all of this got the better of me, finally, and I went out to the truck to look for my notebook. After a quick scramble through the papers, books, cameras and other assorted commuter devris on the back seat, I found the notebook. Although I had not had the time to take many pictures or to sit down and write much of anything lately, a camera and something to write in are aleays in the car, ot in whatever bag I carry, just in case a moment special to me presents itself to be stolen. Resisting once more the temptation to take the camera, I grabbed the notebook and a pen and returned to the waiting room to begin write this.

Kind stranfers have given me a few handsomely bound journals and notebooks over the years. Some, like this one, are bound in beautifully tanned and tooled leather. This one's cover has a giant oak tree cut into it, with other old oaks on a distant ridge beyond it. The big pewter button used for type the notebook closed with a leather thong is case with an oak leaf and acorn detail. I am not much good at keeping a diary, or diligent about any sort of regular jounral entries. My wat to remember has usually been to write stories, poems, or more often than not, to make photographs or drawings. I felt a little rusty and awkward writing in the waiting root under the quierly watchful eyes of the receptionish and Paris. Maybe it didn't seem at all odd to them, my scribbling away. Probably what bothered me was his own sense of guilt over being innclued to record the events surround the processing of your body. Just a short time earlier I had been openly weeping while crossing the city in morning rush-hours traffic. I suppose we humans can be resilient - nearly as resilient as you were, Brigit - and as accpting of life's unpredictably rough patches as most animals seem to be. Whatever the reason, I found I could not write fast enough in my attempy to describe the events of the day.

"Do you want to come out while I clean this out?" the kind voice of the oven-minder asked softly, interrupting me in mid-sentence. I looked up and nodded.

"Yes, please. I'll... let me... let me just finish this sentence - this paragraph. I'll be right there."

"Sure..."

<p style="text-align: center; text-indent: 0;">*</p>

"Do you write a lot?", he asked, as I followed him outside.

"Used to."

"Nice-looking book you got there."

"Thanks. Yes, it is."

I closed it, marking my place with the pen, just as he stopped and turned to me. I was standing on the name spot I had been asked to watch from earlier.

"Please stat right here. I'll shut her down and get everything. You'll be able to see everything happening, but it is very hot now, and also... "

"Yes, ok I'll wait here."
