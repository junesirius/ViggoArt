We came to kill the dead alongside new waters that whispered and winked as they playfully skirted our efforts at perfectly envisioning past misunderstandings. After one of the driest summers in memory, nearly all green had bled from the landscape, leaving cottonwood bark tatter and twig tip as grey as reflected dawn on the creek; pale as wrist scar, frost grass, clay cut bank, and barely-there clouds running for cover to the Black Hills.

We also came to the California desert, hoping some of those who'd died hidden in frozen draws might come a little closer to warming fire and find ground giving enough upon which to finally lay their heads. As much as any careworn ghost shirt, torn voice, trance-footed delirious reincarnation, it was the false thunder of fighter jets on their way back to Babylon, mercilessly cracking the bleached sky above our best intentions, that most made it feel like a morning in December 1890.

It is hoped that words and images in this book might in some way serve as reminders of sacrifices made by people on all sides who suffered from cruelty, confusion, and ignorance in the past. May we look forward with some understanding of what is behind us, and an interest in making the best of what lies ahead.
