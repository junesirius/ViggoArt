When I went to the dance, I went only to see and to learn what the people believed; but now I was going to stay and use the power that had been given me. The dance was over for that day, but they would dance again next day, and I would dance with them.

——Black Elk, Oglala Lakota

In sacred space everything is done so that the environment becomes a metaphor.

Grandfather says, when your friends die you must not cry. You must not hurt anybody or do harm to anyone. You must not fight. Do right always. It will give you satisfaction in life...

I want you to dance every six weeks. Make a feast at the dance and have food that everyone may eat. Then bathe in the water. That is all. You will receive good words again from me sometime. Do not tell lies.

——Wovoka, Paiute

When the buffalo went away the hearts of my people fell to the ground, and they could not lift them up again. After this nothing happened. There was little singing anywhere.

We do not want your sivilization. We would live as our fathers did, and their fathers before them.

I did not know then how much had ended. As I look back now from the high hill of my old age... I can see that something else died there in the bloody mud and was covered up by the blizzard. A people's dream died there. It was a beautiful dream...

——Black Elk, Oglala Lakota

All things are in process, rising and returning. Plants come to blossom, but only to return to the root. Returning to the root is like seeking tranquility. Seeking tranquility is like moving toward destiny. To move toward destiny is like eternity. To know eternity is enlightenment, and not to recognize eternity brings disorder and evil.

——Lao-Tse

Fully three miles from the scene of the massacre we found the body of a woman completely covered with a blanket of snow, and from this point on we found them scattered along as they had been relentlessly hunted down and slaughtered while fleeing for their lives. Some of our people discovered relatives or friends among the dead, and there was much wailing and mourning. When we reached the spot where the Indian camp had stood, among the fragments of burned tents and other belongings we saw the frozen bodies lying close together or piled one upon another...

It took all of my nerve to keep my composure in the face of this spectacle, and of the excitement and grief of my Indian companions, nearly every one of whom was crying aloud or singing his death song. The white men became very nervous, but I set them to examining and uncovering every body to see if one were living. Although they had been lying untended for two days and nights, a number had survived. Among them I found a baby of about a year old warmed wrapped and entirely unhurt. I brough her in, and she was afterward adopted and educated by an army officer. One man who was severely wounded begged me to fill his pipe. We brought him into the chapel. He was welcomed by his wife and daughters with cries of joy, but he died a day or two later.

Under a wagon I discovered an old woman, totally blind and entirely helpless. A few had managed to crawl away to some place of shelter, and we found in a log store nearby several who were badly hurt and others who had died after reaching there. After we had dispatched several wagonloads to the agency, we observed groups of warriorrs watching us from adjacent buttes; probably friends of the victims who had come there for the same purpose of ourselves. A majority of our party, fearing an attack, insisted that someone ride back to the agency for an escortof soldiers, and as mine was the best horse, it fell to me to go. I covered the eighteen miles in quick time and was not interfered with in any way, although if the Indians had meant mischief they could easily have picked my off from any of the ravines and gulches.

All this was a severe ordeal for one who had so lately put all his faith in the Christian love and lofty ideals of the white man. Yet I passed no hasty judgement, and was thankful that I might be of some service and relieve even a small part of the suffering.

——Ohiyesa (Charles Alexander Easrman, M.D.), Yankton Nakota
