My name is Clement "Sonny" Richards. I am a Lakota Iyeska - an interpreter, or "medicine man." For the movie *Hidalgo*, in which a pivotal scene called for the dramatization of the Wounded Knee massacre of 1890 on the Pine Ridge Reservation, I was asked to provide cultural guidance and technical advice. My responsibilities included preparing the appropriate dancers and singers who could uphold the authenticity and integrity of the fateful tragedy that was to be reenacted for the cameras.

When I first stepped onto the set of Chief Big Foot's camp for this scene, it was breathtaking and eerie at the same time: this was a perfect re-creation, down to the last detail. All of the extras felt and expressed the same sense of sorrow and respect for what was going to take place over the course of the coming week. As they reenacted something that had really happened, many said they felt both proud and sad, and that they had gained some understanding of what their relatives must have suffered through.

On the second day of shooting, several extras reported hearing "crying" throughout the encampment, so I was asked to make prayer and give acknowledgement to those who had been killed so ruthlessly years ago. I felt that the best way to honor the memory of the victims was to conduct a sweat lodge ceremony before and after the filming to ensure the safety and respect of all those involved in the re-creation of this historical event, as well as to offer prayers to the lost souls who had been heard crying in the first days of shooting.

Although the film *Hidalgo* is loosely based on real events, the senseless killings that took place at Wounded Knee on that cold day in December 1890 are not in any way a fiction. What happened in that place - as well as what happened in other Indian massacres perpetrated throughout the last five hundred years - is an ugly scar in this country's history. These tragedies need to be shown unflinchingly and acknowledged by the world in the hope that all people can learn from the past and begin healing.

The Ghost Dance today exists more as a rare symbolic ritual than as the regularly performed spiritual ceremony that briefly inspired Lakota and other western tribes at the end of the nineteenth century. It drew much of its original appeal from a sincere desire to right injustices suffered by indigenous people in North America at the hands of European invaders, to enforce treaty agreements made and subsequently violated by both the Canadian and United States governments, and to counter a long history of devastating legislation (that had most recently been examplified by the Dawes Act of 1887, concerning land allotment, which was passed without the required consultation or approval of the native populations it concerned itself with). Today the Ghost Dance represents, for most people, Indian or otherwise, an exotic and often misunderstood memory. If you were to ask a young Native American about the Ghost Dance - who started it and what its purpose was - many would unfortunately not be able to answer your questions. There have been a few Ghost Dance revivals led by various medicine men of different tribes since the early 1970sl however, no consistent effort has been made during the last thirty years to keep it alive and relevant as a ritual. In modern times it is not realistic to pray for the return of the great buffalo herds, to live traditionally and exclusively follow the old ways, or to have European Americans return to Europe and let us live in peace amongst ourselves.

There have been some individuals in this country over the last fifty years who have shown real leadership and, symbolically, represented the noblest motivations of the Ghost Dance. Martin Luther King Jr., for example, was someone who promoted equality and the human rights of all peoples, giving particular attention to the economic and social obstacles faced by minorities. That man, and others like him, have paid dearly for their willingness to stand up for the rights of others and the dream of a truly just society. The same must be true for the Native American community. A person who could organize Ghost Dances, uniting all tribes through prayer, fasting, and commitment, would have to not only be charismatic, spiritually trained, and a fluent speaker of English as well as many Native American languages, but most importantly, this person would have to be willing to risk life and limb for the greater causes of peace and justice as brave leaders have done in the past. This is the only way for significant change to occur.
