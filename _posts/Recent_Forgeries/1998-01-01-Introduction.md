(Written by Dennis Hopper)

<br>

We are beyond art as an object designed to amuse, bewilder, annoy. To inspire reflection is where we finally are, hopefully. Art in the twentieth century has established that it exists not to arouse admiration for only technical excellence, but to use paint and incorporate the found object and concept. Art has a vanishing point. The image from childhood takes me back. A child's head, an arm stretched over a plastic pool out into space. The shoreline may be a cloud, the vanishing point its art. It's your dilemma now. The ball is in your court. It transcends the personal artist's application and becomes yours.

Viggo Mortensen's work comes out of the right place. It comes from the subconscious. The child-creator projects the image into consciousness - you take it back into your subconscious and have your won conscious reaction. These things work for me in Viggo's art. They are immediate and unschooled. Active, free, yet weighted in tradition as new as the computer, as old as Chrisit. Drawings from childhood, computer experiments, canvas, cloth, photographs, rub, scratch, splash, dash. Go for it, Viggo.
