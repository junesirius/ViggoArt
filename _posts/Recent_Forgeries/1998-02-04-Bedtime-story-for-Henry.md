A big white bear sits on top of a white hill way up north - so far north that there are no trees, only snow. Rolling whiteness that seems to go on forever. He is as white as the snow, so he can't be seen. He sits there every day and watches from the hilltop, waiting for something to pass by. The sun is shining today and the sky is blue, so he can see far. First, seven reindeer cross in front of him, the biggest one breaking trail in the snow for the others to follow. After they disappear, a wolf thots by, snigging and looking around as he goes. He's tracking the reindeer. A little later, an eagle flies high overhead, circles lazily three times in front of the sun, then floats away. Now the bear sees something he has never seen before. Stumbling along the reindeer trail is a large creature, walking on its hind legs. It is not graceful. It is not fast. It is noisy and it looks very tired. It is Candy Williams, a remarkably fat woman who doesn't know where she is going. She is wearing white cowboy boots, pink jeans, and a yellow silk shirt covered with feeding stains and throw-up. Over that, she wears a short, synthetic white fur coat. She used to have on an expensive pink cowboy hat, too, but she lost it somewhere. She is wet, she is cold, and she is still a little drunk. Her husband is back at the hotel in Las Vegas. He doesn't know where she went. She took the money he won at cards and flew to Anchorage. Then she chartered a plane to the farthest outpost she could get to. Then she paid an Eskimo a lot of money for his snowmobile and drove it straight out into the wide open whiteness until it ran out of gas. Then she ran out of booze. She has been drunk for a long time. She is trying to keep going. She is not where she wants to be yet.

The bear does not know all these things. He only knows that this is something he has never seen before.
