The afterthought of chimes

filters in from next-door.

I am under the echo, not

listening so much as noticing

it from time to time as

I look over the results

of my landscaping and

weeding from a white

wicker chair.

<br>

An errant vine has sprouted

two blue flowers

where it reaches

roots of the lemon tree.

They are beautiful;

I am suspicious.

Are they a diversion,

an entreaty to keep me

from cutting back the vine?

I'll keep the flowers,

put them in a saucer

by your bed.
