The boy who cried wolf is

the man who can't decide.

Can't lie; never gets away

with it. Saves feathers

he finds, believing

they come from

dreamers' wings.

<br>

Wishing so hard, he

starts looking like

others, absorbs them.

Wishing like that

wears him out

after a while

and then he feels

sorry for himself

and takes it out

on anyone that seems

weak.
