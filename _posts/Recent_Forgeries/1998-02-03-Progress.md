I have recordings of our voices

in rooms now collapsed, of us running

through blue buildings that stood

fifty years. Sounds from a school

where your forehead was reopened

on the shoe-shaped slide. Pictures

of the teal-green tux you wanted

for kindergarten graduation. Of you.

wet-combed hair and red-faced happy,

sitting with your mother, eating cake.
