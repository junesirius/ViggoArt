There hasn't been a summer like this since before the war, so I'm told. Flash lightning from a clear sky when everyone is outside. The animals have been multiplying at night. There is never enough to eat. Forty or fifty murders every day, and God knows how much violence passes for discipline behind tortured walls. Children go around clenching their fists and staring down at their shoes before they know how to read. There have been drownings. Somehow we have forgotten how to swim. It can no longer be taught. The water is dangerous. People are afraid to water their lawns, the bridges are unused. It never rains. The sun is losing its yellow and the clouds are curling up at the edges. The radio plays twenty-year-old songs twenty-four hours a day. I haven't said a word since April.
