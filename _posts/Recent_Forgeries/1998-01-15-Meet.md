There are places behind cathedrals where people come together after mass as openly as they date in the light of day. They also meet in weed gardens, in fallow fields, in stagnant water, many of them on their hands and knees. In cities, these secret unions take cover in the shadow of stifling museums of art and technology, on fire escapes, and in cold basements filled with forgotten junk. They arrive in ones and twos, with wanting eyes in the back of their heads, riding the decayed means of transportation begrudged to the nameless. They wait silently under banks and restaurants for late trains, watching oily brown ropes spin out and stretch for navigating blind, crippled narrows between blackened columns of crumbling marble. Children play there after dark, on the razor rails where rusty wheels only stop shrieking for three hours every night.
