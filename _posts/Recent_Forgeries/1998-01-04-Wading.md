Pieces of you drift by

in the dead of the afternoon

on the yellow tip of a wave.

<br>

The shark that came to shore

at the end of yesterday

rolls sickly, bumping coral

like a tired drunk

to avoid being eaten

at low tide.

He's not afraid of me;

I'm thinking of you.

So much gone from memory

that I'm left with

just your teeth.
