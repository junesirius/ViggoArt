Viggo Mortensen lives in a modest suburban tract house that harbors a secret - a secret that's out the minute you walk through the door: Mortensen is an artist and he is a trifle obsessed. Every inch of his house is given over to artworks, either finished or in progress. There's art in boxes, in stacks, and leaning against walls, which are hung salon-style with yet more art. The place is so layered with art that when Mortensen offers a guest a soda, he has to liberate the refrigerator from the behind several large paintings in order to get to it.

Mixed in with the photographs, paintings, collages, assemblages, sculpture, and drawings are notebooks filled with poems and short stories, as well as odds and ends the artist has retrieved from the streets. Mortensen has the soul of a junkman, and the old signs, chunks of wood, and broken toys he's salvaged may or may not be incorporated into artworks, but he wants them on hand just in case. The house is like a giant compost pile that provides an inexhaustible supply of mulch, and when you see how Mortensen lives, you begin to understand how he produces so much art; it's as if he resides inside a paintbox.

"The garage is full of paintings even bigger than these," Mortensen solemnly confesses, like a child admitting to having broken a window. Despite the crowded conditions, he isn't eager to sell anything. He's attached to his stuff and doesn't want it to leave home.

In "Recent Forgeries," Mortensen shares a selection of work drawn from the vast archive he's accumulated over the last twenty years. An accomplished poet who maintains a parallel career as an actor, Mortensen is self-taught; in this, his work has links to outsider art.

"I don't know much about twentieth-century painters," says Mortensen, who operates on instinct and intuition rather than an intellectualized approach to art-making. "Because of how I was brought up, I go along with it for awhile when somebody tells me about a rule, but eventually I always end up asking myself: Why does it have to be this way?"

Born in Manhattan in 1958, Mortensen is the oldest in a family of three boys. His mother is American, his father Danish, and the family moved frequently throughout his childhood.

"We drew a lot as children and my mother saved much of what we made. Look at this thing I recently found," he says, rummaging under some boxes and pulling out a surprisingly sophisticated abstraction executed in red and green. "I did this when I was seven - and look what the teacher wrote on it: 'Very Poor!' I wish I could make a painting like that now," he adds, studying the drawing intently.

Graduating from high school in Watertown, New York, in 1976, Mortensen began taking photographs while he was still in school. "I was taking lots of pictures in the late seventies and used to be really anxious about always having a camera with me - it got a little out of hand," he recalls. "It seemed that there was always something going on that I could be taking a picture of, and I suppose I eventually started feeling a little removed from life. I'm actually shooting more these days, but I'm thinking primarily about color now and assuming the framing will take care of itself since I've been doing it for so long. It's a much looser and more relaxed way of working."

The fruits of Mortensen's years of picture-taking can be seen everywhere in his house; there are literally thousands of photographs, framed and unframed, laying around in no particular order. Looking through a randomly selected pile of images, one is struck by the lyricism that infuses Mortensen's pictures of suburban backyards, a bullfight in Spain, a bride running down the steps of a small Midwestern church as she leaves her groom at the altar, a melancholy elephant, a farm in Denmark. The images are tender and curiously chaste; there's rarely anything violent or crudely sexual in Mortensen's photographs.

His paintings have a bit more edge, revolving as they do around the layering of disparate elements; text, for instance, will be faintly scribbled over an image painted onto a scrap of patterned wallpaper that's been glued to an old door. The aggression of this unholy mix of materials is intensified by the large scale that Mortensen often favors.

"I'm not arrogant enough to say I haven't been influenced by anyone, but the way I work has mostly been shaped just by being in the world and looking," he says. "I saw some shows in New York last fall, including the Rauschenberg retrospective at the Guggenheim, and there were things that made me think, oh no, some of my stuff really looks like this - people might think I am stealing."

"So much has already been done and there's not much that's new," he concludes. "You can't let that stop you though, because the actual exercise of just poking around in the debris is worthwhile. Even if you produce stuff that's interesting to nobody but yourself, the activity justifies itself. Making things is a way of finding out."
