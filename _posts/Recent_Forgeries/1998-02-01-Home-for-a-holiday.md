Between cars rolling up to the intersection

a piece of the sun strobes weakly, pulls

his eyes through exhausted asphalt swells,

across the street and into a brick wall

that stands in for the horizon.

<br>

Nobody knows him here anymore.

He's walking the city east to west,

stopping only to absorb the surprise

feeling of belonging to himself

on a street corner as lights come on

in windows and late shoppers pass him by.

<br>

He leaves the road, hurries into the park

to relieve himself behind a eucalyptus,

and thinks of the first time he put his hand

up against the white tile wall over a urinal

in some airport when he was eight

after seeing his father do it.
