She told me she was in love, and that she just wanted to enjoy it for as long as it lasted. That she didn't want to judge the feeling, compare it to other times with other partners. There was nothing gained from analysing, she said - all it did was rob you of time better spent in those new arms. There wasn't anything for me to say. I listened, and imagined the memorable summer she was having. Sitting across from her, I could feel how easily her breathing came. She seemed stronger than I remembered. It was pleasant to be with her. I forgot about my work, my family, the weather - everything. I almost forgot to pay the check. Suddenly, she was kissing me on the cheek and hurrying home to him, leaving me staring out the plate glass at the lushness of a willow. After finishing my coffee, I walked slowly across the park, in no hurry to the office.
