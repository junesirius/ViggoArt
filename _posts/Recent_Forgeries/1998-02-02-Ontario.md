Her good moods were temporary as crackhouses, cloud shadows. She pulled flowers from the earth, turned out the lights, and went to the roof to read the love letter she had sent to herself. She finished other people's sentences for them, usually taking off on wild tangents that left the bushwhacked in stunned attendance on the strange rerouting of conversation. She walked leaning as far forward as gravity would allow, like a heron peeking into a hole in the ice. When she washed the windows, she tried in vain to see the other side of the lake, thirty-two miles away. Wore all her jewels all the time, sounding like a sack of broken chandeliers when she moved in her sleep. Sometimes she got sullen and withdrawn, and couldn't get anything done.
