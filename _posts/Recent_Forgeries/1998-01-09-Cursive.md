Outside, foreplay of rain clouds. Inside, you write in your diary - probably about the argument we've been having on and off all morning. Little pen, never stops. Nothing omitted, everything rewritten. Shared past becomes rope, stretches necks. We don't fight, we don't lose. Shorthands present you. I am exposed. It's not personal, you say, it's art. It's defence, I say. I'll put on my clothes.
