They wound up into the hills, knowing only that they were climbing away from the city's main drags. Past the stacks of well-tended and unattended residences; investments for some and just homes for others. Irrigated, orderly, protected. Steep driveways twisting back darkly from jungled gateways, forbidding entrances hinting at mysterious fruits of mysterious labours. Not a dog or pedestrian to be seen, only confident headlights whipping into view out of the tropical night. With each startling turn of the pinched road they'd smell a different kind of flower. They couldn't stop grinning at their great fortune: these were the homes of movie stars, of illicit meetings, intoxicated palm gardens, unknown phone numbers - the breeding grounds of fame! Suddenly, they were out in the open again, on a deserted bend of Mulholland where they hung high above the fireworked valley. This was better than the view yesterday from the Griffith Observatory - or maybe just as good, only different. They had driven up and down the phone-pole filthiness of Santa Monica Boulevard and found it uplifting. They had swum in the Pacific Ocean. They had walked Hollywood Boulevard, in and out of movie theatres just to look at the posters. Reverent as they examined the Jeams Dean stores. Wildly exuberant through humped-up Saturday-night traffic. It was all part of a wonderful secret, an infinite number of welcoming gifts that had lain waiting in the sun.
