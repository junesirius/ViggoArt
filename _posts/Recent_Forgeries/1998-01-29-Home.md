He's got a deep, abiding respect

verging on idol worship

for where things end up.

There are unopened letters

in his refrigerator, a fake

fingernail in a soapdish,

shoes everyplace.

These things, and many more

leavings, fragments, balancing

reminders of a breeze

from a slammed door - 

configurations of sanctified loose ends - 

have become the living net

above which he performs

the movements that make

the clock work.
