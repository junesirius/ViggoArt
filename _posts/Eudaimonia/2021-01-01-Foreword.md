The images in this book were made in late 2018, during a period of 8 to 10 days, while listening to various radio news broadcasts from the U.S. - ranging from right-wing conspiracy-ridden ramblings to left-wing conspiracy-ridden ramblings and all manner of relatively objective, middle-of-the-road straight news presentations in between. The most-discussed person in all of the broadcasts was Donald Trump, and the overriding concern expressed across the board, for better and for worse, seemed to be the perceived socio-political impact of his presidency. The poem "Eudaimonia" was written in May of 2020, during Spain's first COVID-19-related lockdown.
