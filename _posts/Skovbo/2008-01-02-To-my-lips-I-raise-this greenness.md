To my lips I raise this greenness, 

This viscous vow of leaves,

This vow-violating earth, 

Mother to snowdrops, maples, young oaks,

<br>

Look at me - I grow stronger, blinder, 

Stooping before these submissive roots;

Can my eyes endure the grandeur

of this thunderous grove?

<br>

And the voices of the croaking ones, 

They all come together, like drops of mercury,

And the twigs becomes branches,

And the mist becomes make-believe.

<br>

——Osip Emilyevich Mandelstam

(Translation by Stanislav Shvabrin and VM)
