Pregnant piano leans, patient, drops ones and threes, bruised fruits

that open

and decay, carrying echoes in skins and stones, remembering

their trees.

Instrumental, pale journey at dusk, levelling expectation, the sun.

Sink, dark

tatters, near still. Decomposed, free to rot, grow new lips, fingers,

ears, fragile

with chords grey as the following rain, insisting on horizons of their

own.

<br>

Minerva, lake of feeling your way, the icicle, muddy slush fills nose,

you slip

but keep to melting path through ghost brambles, receding, coal

shawled,

lights in your tears and a meal in your mind, pencils, iris wrapped in

chamois,

lap pockets blush in cloud wrinkles, nightgown ever-so-tea-stained,

set

brush to work blue-fingered, lone odes saves up in boxes, hung hither

and dawn.

<br>

Oblivious to dead fire, untasted tomato, the incessant knock and

wrestling

of strange relatives, baked morsels, smoke from black brick valley

hearths.

Dead berry, hay bales, firmament a tarnished platter sewn with winks

skirmish

resides, echoes you easily ignore, fixing your milky view on cidery wood

grain

nobody notices but to hew and smooth, stain, notch heights and dates

forgotten.

<br>

Your own company keeps candles, makes waters, begs no interference.

Slate hand

shifts loose ribbons adrift, flare of last star in the window bids you sleep

forget the

foot you mangled and erased, redrew as softly as ripples on your father's

cozy corner

sweated satin pillow, anticipate, accept, monogrammed, welcomed, ripe

red view.

Yet-eager white lashes sail over rumbling snores, muffled chimes whisper

your names.

<br>

Pictures and word, mouth and member, distressed syllable, rest, rouse, bell

held still.

Summer threatens and all you see is cheese, cheddar and lovely, oily hard

to knife,

crumbling as weeds take hold, and the knocking on the door for once and

all stops.

They know we are home and know we have heard, at least a little, their coo,

presence

palpable concern, curiosity, need to see for themselves what needn't be told

or shown.
