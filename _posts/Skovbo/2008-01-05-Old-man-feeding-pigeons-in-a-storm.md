*(Every moment of light and dark is a miracle. —— Walt Whitman)*

<br>

Wind's up, peeled plane tree boughs look like shearing, sailing through windows. Clouds knot, chatter's choked. Bridges bend downstream. And then it breaks off, dies in the hills to the south, suddenly demure. Moon-cloth snags, turns, gathers alee sewer moss shoal, under tarred pilings, spreads. Sinks. Still, all still. Bared pate slides into opportune light measure, shines lensward one historical moment. Shadows, too, glow faintly, fitfully with one last blush. Dusk bids gazes drain, unmoors desire, quells ambition, erases boundaries, quiets flagstaffs, drops table leaves, scrapes ledges, passes under dove soaring, brings few dinner, lets dust lie, fancies gloom, fades rails, sills, embankment steps, cuts telephone lines, blinds footpaths, starts stories, unschools, waylays meddling masters, allows self-examination, halts intrusion, invites exhale, vanishes wisp-haired nestling shoulders, marries blood to cheek, gathers shawls, cups chins, descends whispering, pardons all, understands some start living, some are done.
