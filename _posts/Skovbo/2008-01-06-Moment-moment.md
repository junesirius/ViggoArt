All channels of self-expression constrict, performance increasingly seasoned with regret, breathing through elbows, kicking feebly against imagined restraints, gesture lacking earlier effortlessness, thoughtlessness. Perceived emotional state ironically appears to gain in imploded intensity, even as complexity of vain struggle clouds lenses, closes avenues of escape, simultaneously relaying and disavowing unfocused interior chatter, gifting disassociated fragments to fewer and fewer curious bystanders lingering to reserve judgement and soak up leaking half thoughts, unrefined transitions, broken rhythms, inexplicably missed opportunities that keep interpretation from rising on one sustained exhalation, riding one dented, reverberating trace note.
