Went away

finally

got yours

sit near

daybreak

somplace

in the garden

your roses

nearly

visible

in last

moonlight

smoke at ease

morning coffee

forgotten

doves

awake

flee

the mad

dogs you'd

rather not

restrain

or scold

right now

no reason

for talks as

others sleep

might

betterenjoy

the day

that's coming.

(Translation by VM)
