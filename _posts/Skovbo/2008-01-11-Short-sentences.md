Do not believe in anything simply because you have heard it or because it has been handed down for many generations, or because it is found written in your religious books, or merely on the authority of your teachers and elders. When you know for yourself that something is unhealthy, that when entered upon and undertaken it inclines towards harm and suffering, you should reject it. When you know for yourself that something is healthy, that when entered upon and undertaken it inclines towards welfare and happiness, you should stay with is.

——Buddha

What a wonderful miracle

if only we could look through

each other's eyes for an instant.

——Henry David Thoreau

<br>

There are moments in life

when a kind of beautiful

born of the multiplicity of 

troubles that assail us.

——Marcel Proust

(Translation by VM)

<br>

The real journey is not about

seeking new landscapes,

but about looking with new eyes.

——Marcel Proust

(Translation by VM)

Tanta acción de un

destino acaba en alma...

——Jorge Guillén
