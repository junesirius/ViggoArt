There they go, over the lesser blue.

Told you I saw one the other day.

There they are, under the bridge.

I've sometimes felt their breath.

There they drift, never at rest.

No matter, you didn't miss a thing.

They are many, but you won't know

their errands, just like you and me,

busy dying. I happened upon one,

like a swallow gracing twilight, straggler

pausing, looking my way, like a deer

in meadow shadow, moose in the river

by cedar banks, lost in my side mirror.

I buried myself in radio chatter, eyes

sacked in unacknowledged sorrow, back

to weary level stare, not receiving, deaf

to pleas, barking, the ant on my knuckle.

They're the ones we have so much

in common with but don't call, don't

welcome, and try life without. I drive.
