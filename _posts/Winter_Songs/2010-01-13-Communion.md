We've left shore, somehow become the friends of early theory, close enough to speak of desire and pain of absence, of mistakes we'd make given the chance. Each smile returned makes harder avoiding dreams that see us lying in early evening curtain shadows, skin safe against skin. Bloom of compassion, respect for moments eyes lock, turns forever into one more veil that falls away.

<br>

This after seeing you last night, first time smelling you with permission: shoulders to wonder openly at, as carefully kissed as those arms waited impossibly on. They've held me now, and your soft breath down my back allayed gusts that had me shaking in the unlit Anglican doorway.

<br>

Are we ruined for finding that our faces fit and wanting to know more about morning? Is our relationship erased if we can no longer call each other in amnesia, invite ourselves to last glances under suspecting clocks telling us when we've had enough?

<br>

Your steady hands cradling my grateful skull: were you taking in my face to save an image you'd sometimes allow yourself after abandoning that cold alcove? Am I a photograph you gaze at in moments of weakness? You order me off my knees and into your arms. It wasn't to beg that I knelt; only to see you once from below. I tried to say something that filled my mouth and longed to rest in your ear. Don't dare write it down for fear it'll become words, just words.
