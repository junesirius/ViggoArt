We've convinced ourselves the worst has passed

enter the street to see ourselves in sunlight

finding the transient rhythm

that frees and erases us

traversing neighbourhoods and memories

dodging shit and stomped tickets

caged by dreams of others

those prefabricated loves

timed-release systems

we rehearse future virtual flights

encouraged by gusts of carnal recognition

with gazes imprisoned

by the absurdly precise line

of a false horizon

just let the years raise themselves

we must find a name for the orphan dawn
