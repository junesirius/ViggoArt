Oceans take our secrets

what we don't want to see or smell anymore

we feel clean

when we throw our past away

it will wash

we think

it will sink

it will drift far from this shore

it will disappear

maybe the fish will eat our words

maybe lost or spurned loves

will help deep-sea feathery plants grow

<br>

Now and again I find myself

crossing the soaking sand

looking for tears and exotic messages

in the sliding foam

that barely baptises my feet

sometimes there's something clear and obvious

a fingernail or a plastic bag

will never know for sure

who threw them away

once I found a wedding ring

uncovered by the receding tide

didn't touch it

I was already married
