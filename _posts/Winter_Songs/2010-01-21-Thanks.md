A life of scattered minutes

after all the waiting

suddenly

and obviously together

doing nothing to stay

the past

the present

the school

languages

nests

friends lost

gods of others

the future

gods I don't know

beloved banner

rhythm of the wounded hand

we barely respect

the beauty

and common sense

of our twining

the logic

of our crossed words

the well-blended perfume

of our breathing

the peculiar harmony

of our voices

can I join

sincerely

ask for affection

without the trembling

of expectation

understand

and accept

if it's never given?
