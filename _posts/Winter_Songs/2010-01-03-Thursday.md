I take the phone to bed

seeming so far from you

keep dreaming you call me

that I wake up

that the moon joins us

binding us at sundown

and sunrise

erasing the hours

<br>

The knot of fear dissolves

in that Resonant Country

where there's time for everything

<br>

At five

the wind rattles the windows

and I rise

ready the water

prepare the tea

make the bed

knowing

without seeing myself in the dirty pane

that it's just me

in autumn and standing in the doorway

awaiting the light

of another Thursday
