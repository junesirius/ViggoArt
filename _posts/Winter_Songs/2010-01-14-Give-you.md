what I can

what I know

what I hope

you will see

what I fear

you will see

will know

what I feel

pray

give you

what's left

breath

look at

frame's memory

in the cold stove

my hands I give you

river's waters

mountains

my darkness

give you

what I hide

in the forest

forget

do not find

give you

what I recall

yesterday's clouds

the crying floor

empty house

chair

shout

regret

doubt

bats

swallows

absence of hope

bee I give you

my fingers

paupered words

give you what I have

no news at all

give you

give you

shame

give you

broken nights

this endless day

and its punishing sun

give you

vein

eyes

everything

I discover

live

die

give you

my resignation

sorrow

frailty

desire

the glass

I clean 

I give you

so you'll never

feel 

completely

alone
