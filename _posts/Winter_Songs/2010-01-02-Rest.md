When you return

tonight

I'll be asleep

dancing with you

happy

as the Jewish wedding in your garden

cradled by echo of laughter

fragile vows

murmurs of approval

dreaming of seeing you once more

grazing your cheek with mine

smelling you little by little

recognising your mouth

sinking in your eye

enfolded again

being ourselves
