There are days

hours

moments in which I surrender

am exhausted by knowing how little I know

that we've chosen to punish ourselves

days

hours

moments that wrench

and distract

perhaps you also go from weeping

to laughing at yourself

at roadblocks

stains on your skin

and the long way down

<br>

Sometimes I unfurl the farewell flag

look at it

clean it

kiss it

touch my forehead to it

and hang it a while from the balcony

but there are other days

hours

moments that float

and allow me to calmly understand

that you exist

breathe

sleep

smile

dream as I do

dance

walk

and that I'm fortunate

to know you a little in this life

because of those days

so many

those hours

precious

those moments

infinite

I keep retiring that flag

returning it to its hiding place

carefully folded

that's why

when parting curtains

to see the horizon

I imagine you living in

and open the window

in case a breeze brings me your scent

I've not yet jumped
