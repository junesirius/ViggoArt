This northern February dawn, listening to the second movement, I recall a long vernal flight, your budding sweat, some of the stray words we searched for and which sometimes found their way to us. I retake the country stroll with the deaf master, seeing how he pauses by the stream, smelling the fresh weeds, fine leather shows and white silk stockings caked with mud. He wanders alone and enchanted, the grey-haired child, his universe in bloom, forever free to ignore riots of crows in full scream.

I am detained by those delicate, anemic blue clouds, frozen watercolour, the ones you just gave me over the phone. I remain standing by the road, admiring them until they lose themselves and the cold sends me home for shelter. There I pass the day, lying on the floor beneath the window and the dead radiator, clothed in all of the shirts you've given me, but barefoot. The sun is here. It comes and goes in the mist, dancing mischievously on the roof tiles like the cat that waits to hide itself just when I look up. I stop writing for a good while to watch the Lazarus light suddenly adore everything and then die, time and again. At nightfall I am left with echoes of violins, birds, cellos, and the image of an alpine meadow shining in rebirth. I am caressed by the distant song of the stream and the nightingale, the quail, and I don't know what other voice. In this moment I understand perfectly the luck of being and being loved.
