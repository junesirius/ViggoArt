Awaiting waters

you promised me

that I need

to grow

to believe you present

feel I am yours

<br>

Whatever happens

I'll remember this March evening

my impatience

your reverberating farewell

<br>

Learn to ingest

in good faith the rhythm

of your tidiest reasoning

careful on the stairs

worn and slippery

descend in twilight

without looking at the tower clock

to search for you in the warm drizzle

remember you won't be coming today

but insist on seeing us together

already forgiven

far away

from yesterday's delirium

<br>

Know I'm drowning

staring at the sun

unreachable

and joyful in its fury

through currents

that shake me

anchor me frozen

to the rocky bottom

of the river that always leaves

<br>

Did you notice

I moved the flowers?

and they are new

barely resemble

those that watched over

our last ascension

but if you no longer visit

how will you know

although little has changed

that everything is different?
