I always tell you whatever I'm thinking without considering the danger. I capsize, fall towards your mouth, live on your permission. Your gaze moors me, comforts me. Thousand of kilometers away I feel you are open, smiling when I describe the things I want to do to you. I see your stretched neck, injured finger, cracked lips. Want you to see me as I am, confess each detail of this hunger, rejoice in our blood, get closer with each drop I spill, that you spill. I say everything, and you listen. I know I may regret it, that some kind of harm awaits us, that there is danger. We're doing fine now, but in essence... yes, there is danger.

<br>

You cleaned the remains of our uprooting on that strange bed of other dreams quickly and well with a wet cloth, but the water left another stain, heart-shaped. Perfect. Remember?

Look, I said.

Yes...

See?

Yes.

What you made!

Yes, yes, my love. I see it.

I'm broken and you begin to realise how little I serve you this way. But I'm yours. I returned last night to see where we'd lain, and the heart you unwittingly drew on the light blue coverlet. It had dried, leaving only the pale shadow of your hand.

<br>

What do I do with this grief, and what do you do with yours? We are imprisoned and united by the business of our separation. We cannot help each other. I'm dragged by exile, injured by the sky. My bones ache from ignoring so much - in silence, in taxis, planes, in the street, alone and by phone when others sometimes call and hang up without daring to mention what they've already understood. My eyes are grey scars, feeble shadows that have no idea how to illuminate what ails me and where I carelessly put my head.

<br>

How do you manage not to call me now? Before, you could never help yourself. Before, you did so constantly and at all hours. It saved me. I suffered, but I knew you were in an exact place. Seated, naked, alone, surrounded by... newspapers and books. You'd tell me how your day had gone, that today. Imagining it filled me, satisfied me for a while, helped me find the ground, sleep, wake up without you, ready fire and water, live. What will I do without your hands? I'll encounter other breezes, another summer under another sun, while you enter your night. When it's my turn to see new stars, or the lack of them, little by little I'll get used to it.
